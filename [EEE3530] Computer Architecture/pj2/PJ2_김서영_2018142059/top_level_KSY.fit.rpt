Note: For more information on problematic transfers, consider running the Fitter again with the Optimize hold timing option (Settings Menu) turned off.
This will disable optimization of problematic paths and expose them for further analysis using either the TimeQuest Timing Analyzer or the Classic Timing Analyzer.
