Note: For more information on problematic transfers, consider running the Fitter again with the Optimize hold timing option (Settings Menu) turned off.
This will disable optimization of problematic paths and expose them for further analysis using either the TimeQuest Timing Analyzer or the Classic Timing Analyzer.

Info: *******************************************************************
Info: Running Quartus II Fitter
    Info: Version 9.0 Build 235 06/17/2009 Service Pack 2 SJ Web Edition
    Info: Processing started: Sun Jun 14 01:16:45 2020
Info: Command: quartus_fit --read_settings_files=off --write_settings_files=off project3_KSY -c project3_KSY
Info: Selected device EP1AGX50DF1152I6 for design "project3_KSY"
Info: Low junction temperature is -40 degrees C
Info: High junction temperature is 100 degrees C
Info: Fitter is performing an Auto Fit compilation, which may decrease Fitter effort to reduce compilation time
Warning: Feature LogicLock is not available with your current license
Info: Device migration not selected. If you intend to use device migration later, you may need to change the pin assignments as they may be incompatible with other devices
    Info: Device EP1AGX60EF1152C6 is compatible
    Info: Device EP1AGX60EF1152I6 is compatible
    Info: Device EP1AGX50DF1152C6 is compatible
    Info: Device EP1AGX90EF1152C6 is compatible
    Info: Device EP1AGX90EF1152I6 is compatible
Info: Fitter converted 1 user pins into dedicated programming pins
    Info: Pin ~DATA0~ is reserved at location J20
Info: Design uses memory blocks. Violating setup or hold times of memory block address registers for either read or write operations could cause memory contents to be corrupted. Make sure that all memory block address registers meet the setup and hold time requirements.
